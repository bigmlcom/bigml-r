This repo contains the source code used to generate the BigML api bindings 
for R.  

Please, report problems and bugs to our
[BigML.io issue tracker](https://github.com/bigmlcom/io/issues)

Discussions about the different bindings take place in the general
[BigML mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/bigml). Or join us
in our [Campfire chatroom](https://bigmlinc.campfirenow.com/f20a0)

There is a small bundle.R script that will build a CRAN-ready bundle.
[Roxygen2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html) is 
necessary for building the package documentation.  Simply run the script in 
R while in the project directory.
